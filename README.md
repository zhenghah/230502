# A BERT-based pretraining model for extracting molecular structural information from a SMILES sequence

'datasetMake_pretrain.ipynb' is used to prepare input and target data for pretraining, it also creat a file for saving the dictionary of symbols.
'pretrain.ipynb' is used to conduct pre-training experiment.
'PropertyPred.ipynb' is used to conduct experiment of molecular properties.

Remember to change all file path to the path in your system.
